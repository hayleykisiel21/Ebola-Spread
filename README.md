# Ebola-Spread

A short term social model which displays the spread of Ebola throughout a society.

## Description 

It's hard to imagine that just one person can cause a virus outbreak in a society, but it's much easier to visualize. Using NetLogo, this model visualizes the transmission and perpetuation of the Ebola virus throughout a human population. This is a modified version of NetLogo Virus model (Wilensky, U) which is modified to directely represent the spread of the Ebola virus, including who the disease targets, the death rate, contamination patterns, and vaccination effectiveness. The following are parameters which can be modified to show variations of the Ebola outbreak in different types of enviroments around the world: infected rate, immunity rate, immunity length, healthcare status, and population size.
